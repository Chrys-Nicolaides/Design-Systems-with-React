# My very own Design System! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

Design systems include a series of reusable UI Components to develop new experiences.

These pre-defined, reusable UI components allow teams to build scalable, complex and accessible user interfaces across multiple projects at a faster pace. They serve as tools for both designers and developers, with the objective of creating consistency and a clear set of shared goals when building websites and applications, including multiple elements from components, patterns and colour use to more abstract principles such as brand and product values. These systems take previously encountered challenges and issues into account and provide a better, more informed way of building systems that provide a more consistent, unified user experience. These systems provide a more efficient way for designers and developers to produce work faster and make the collaboration and handoff process overall a lot smoother.

### ‚ÄúA Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.‚Äù - UX Collective.

As my knowledge and understanding of design systems grow, I aim to update, improve and further develop this project into a complete library of reusable components - all guided by rules that enforce consistency and speed üòé
